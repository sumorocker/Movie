                <p>The Shinning, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a psychological thriller loosely
                based on a Steven King Novel. It takes place in Colorado at the Overlook hotel. Our
                protagonist Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson) and his wife(Shelley Duvall) 
                and son Danny(Danny Lloyd) take residence at the Overlook when Jack is accepted in
                the position of winter caretaker. A position he took in hopes that the isolation might
                break his writers block.</p>

                <p>Jack's son Danny suffers from seizures that we learn are caused by a psychic sensitivity
                to people and the past, an ability that becomes known as Shinning. All the while Jack is
                frustratingly trying to overcome his writers block and cabin fever begins to set in causing
                him slowly to loose touch.</p>

                becomes part of it. He sets out to murder his wife and child who must attempt to survive far from
                any help and cut off from any roads by the harsh winter weather.</p>
